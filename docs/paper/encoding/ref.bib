	abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ({QAOA}) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisﬁes a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisﬁed. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the {QAOA} has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the {QAOA} can exhibit a form of “Quantum Supremacy” in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be eﬃciently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm ({QADI}) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the {QADI} but even with this oracle, if one could eﬃciently classically sample from the output of the {QAOA}, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the {QAOA} is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing Quantum Supremacy.},

	abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.},

	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm ({QAOA}) has rapidly become a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithm development. Despite a growing range of applications, only a few results have been developed towards understanding the algorithms ultimate limitations. Here we report that {QAOA} exhibits a strong dependence on a problem instances constraint to variable ratio - this problem density places a limiting restriction on the algorithms capacity to minimize a corresponding objective function (and hence solve optimization problems). Such 'reachability deficits' persist even in the absence of barren plateaus [{McClean} et al., 2018] and are outside of the recently reported level-1 {QAOA} limitations [Hastings 2019]. Building on general numerical experiments, we compare the presence of reachability deficits with analytic solutions of the variational model of Grover's search algorithm.},

The goal is to identify a linear boolean function which describes the action of q on a certain subset of n-bit strings. We prove that any classical probabilistic circuit composed of bounded fan-in gates that solves the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem with high probability must have depth logarithmic in n.

	abstract = {We give a quantum algorithm for solving instances of the satisﬁability problem, based on adiabatic evolution. The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a ﬁnal Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired ﬁnal ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy diﬀerence between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisﬁability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

	abstract = {We consider some classical and quantum approximate optimization algorithms with bounded depth. First, we define a class of "local" classical optimization algorithms and show that a single step version of these algorithms can achieve the same performance as the single step {QAOA} on {MAX}-3-{LIN}-2. Second, we show that this class of classical algorithms generalizes a class previously considered in the literature, and also that a single step of the classical algorithm will outperform the single-step {QAOA} on all triangle-free {MAX}-{CUT} instances. In fact, for all but \$4\$ choices of degree, existing single-step classical algorithms already outperform the {QAOA} on these graphs, while for the remaining \$4\$ choices we show that the generalization here outperforms it. Finally, we consider the {QAOA} and provide strong evidence that, for any fixed number of steps, its performance on {MAX}-3-{LIN}-2 on bounded degree graphs cannot achieve the same scaling as can be done by a class of "global" classical algorithms. These results suggest that such local classical algorithms are likely to be at least as promising as the {QAOA} for approximate optimization.},

A depth-p {QAOA} consists of p interleaved unitary transformations induced by two mutually non-commuting Hamiltonians. A long-standing question concerning the performance of {QAOA} is the dependence of its success probability as a function of circuit depth p. We make initial progress by analyzing the success probability of {QAOA} for realizing state transfer in a one-dimensional qubit chain using two-qubit {XY} Hamiltonians and single-qubit Hamiltonians. We provide analytic state transfer success probability dependencies on p in both low and large p limits by leveraging the unique spectral property of the {XY} Hamiltonian. We support our proof under a given {QAOA} ansatz with numerical optimizations of {QAOA} for up to {\textbackslash}(N{\textbackslash})=20 qubits. We show that the optimized {QAOA} can achieve the well-known quadratic speedup, Grover speedup, over the classical alternatives. Treating {QAOA} optimization as a quantum control problem, we also provide numerical evidence of how the circuit depth determines the controllability of the {QAOA} ansatz.},

Here, we study the performance of {QAOA} on the {MaxCut} combinatorial optimization problem, optimizing the quantum circuits on a classical computer using automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent, using {QuantumFlow}, a quantum circuit simulator implemented with {TensorFlow}. We find that we can amortize the training cost by optimizing on batches of problems instances; that {QAOA} can exceed the performance of the classical polynomial time Goemans-Williamson algorithm with modest circuit depth, and that performance with fixed circuit depth is insensitive to problem size. Moreover, {MaxCut} {QAOA} can be efficiently implemented on a gate-based quantum computer with limited qubit connectivity, using a qubit swap network. These observations support the prospects that {QAOA} will be an effective method for solving interesting problems on near-term quantum computers.},

	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm ({QAOA}) is a promising quantum-classical hybrid technique to solve combinatorial optimization problems in near-term gate-based noisy quantum devices. In {QAOA}, the objective is a function of the quantum state, which itself is a function of the gate parameters of a multi-level parameterized quantum circuit ({PQC}). A classical optimizer varies the continuous gate parameters to generate distributions (quantum state) with signiﬁcant support to the optimal solution. Even at the lowest circuit depth, {QAOA} offers nontrivial provable performance guarantee which is expected to increase with the circuit depth. However, existing analysis fails to consider nonidealities in the qubit quality i.e., short lifetime and imperfect gate operations in realistic quantum hardware. In this article, we investigate the impact of various noise sources on the performance of {QAOA} both in simulation and on a real quantum computer from {IBM}. Our analyses indicate that optimal number of stages (p-value) for any {QAOA} instance is limited by the noise characteristics (gate error, coherence time, etc.) of the target hardware as opposed to the current perception that higherdepth {QAOA} will provide monotonically better performance for a given problem compared to the low-depth implementations.},
