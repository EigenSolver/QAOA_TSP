# Research on Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm versus Quantum Annealing
Collaborator: Yongcheng Ding, Yuning Zhang, Bin Cheng

## TSP Problems
- Quantum Annealing (D-Wave)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm(Huawei HiQ Simulator)
- Classical Algorithm (Dynamic Programming, Ant Colony Algorithm)

## Contents
- ./analysis/: jupyter notebooks or scripts to process benchmarking data
- ./data/: data file generated by the execution script
- ./quantum_annealing/ : quantum annealing algorithm for TSP run on DWave quantum annealer
- ./docs/ : shared ducuments, including research papers on recent progress of QAOA, technical documents of DWave annealer and our research notes

## Library
the algorithms used in this project is capsulated into a indepedent package https://github.com/Neuromancer43/QAOA_LIB


## Addressd Targets

- approximated QAOA time complexity with increased problem scaling (iterations x time per iter, evaluated by experimental data of superconducting circuit)
- QAOA space complexity with increased problem scaling (scale of circuit, depth x qubits)
- optimizer performance (iteration, loacl minimum)
- approximate ratio (optimized objective function/global optimum)
